`This is not a full stop, it's a period`

Please also tag your issue with the appropriate tags.

### Submitting Pull Requests
Please send a (pull request here)[https://github.com/choyiny/afullstop/pulls]. It would be awesome if you included a description of what you have done and simple documentation if you included javascript or CSS code. Before you submit your PR, please make sure you have done the following:

- Make sure you have the most up-to-date fork so you minimize the chance of running into code conflicts.
- Make sure your code is properly indented to standards of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

#### Creating a new page design
If you are creating a new page design or is modifying an existing one, please make sure your changes are viewable at your Github Pages `username.github.io/afullstop`. Your PR will not be merged without a working preview.

Create a new HTML page and clone the existing `404.html` template. Name your page something informative, for example, `animation.html` if you have done something related to `animate.css` or animation with javascript.

#### Credits
We would love to credit you. When you make a pull request and it has been approved, please add your name to `README.md` in the contributors section.
