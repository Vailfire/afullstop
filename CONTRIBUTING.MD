### 1. Forking
Make sure you have the most up-to-date fork so you minimize the chance of running into code conflicts.

### 2. Code Formatting
Make sure your code is properly indented to the standards of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### 3. Creating a new page design
Create a new HTML page and clone the existing `404.html` template. Name your page something informative. If you are mainly adding animations, `animation.html` would be a good file name.
